I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. </p>

Previously, I was a Visiting Faculty Researcher at Google. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the <a href="https://foda.berkeley.edu/">Foundations of Data Analystics Institute</a> at University of California, Berkeley and was very fortunate to work with <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/">Michael Mahoney</a>. Before that, I was a Research Fellow in the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/dl2019">Foundations of Data Science</a> program at the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/">Simons Institute</a> in Fall 2018. I graduated with my PhD from <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>, where I was very fortunate to be able to learn from and interact with Professors <a href="http://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu/ghosh">Joydeep Ghosh</a>, and <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/">Alex Dimakis</a>. I am interested in various aspects of algorithmic machine learning, both from theory and practical viewpoints
