    <p> I am currently a Visiting Faculty Researcher at Google. In Spring 2022, I will be joining Department of Computer Science at Purdue University as an Assistant Professor. 

	<p> Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the <a href="https://foda.berkeley.edu"> Foundations of Data Analystics Institute</a> at University of California, Berkeley and am very fortunate to be working with <a href=https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/>Michael Mahoney</a>. Before that, I was a Research Fellow in the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/dl2019">Foundations of Data Science</a> program at the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/">Simons Institute</a> in Fall 2018. I graduated with my PhD from <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>. I am very fortunate to be able to learn from and interact with Professors <a href="http://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu/ghosh">Joydeep Ghosh</a>, and <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/"> Alex Dimakis</a>. My PhD research is to study various aspects of greedy algorithms in machine learning, both from theory and practical viewpoints. From the theory side, I have worked on studying approximation guarantees for "greedy-like" algorithms for sparsity and rank constrained problems for general functions based on their smoothness and convexity, and convergence rates for greedy algorithms like accelerated IHT, Matching Pursuit and boosting . From practical side, I have worked on using greedy selections for approximate variational inference for sparse regression, sparse PCA for fMRI applications, and for interpreting black box models. In the past I have worked on problems involving predicting buying propensity based on marketing touches, large scale recommendation systems, Ad Click prediction, and ranking.
