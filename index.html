	I'm a 5th year PhD student in Intelligent Data Exploration and Analysis Laboratory (<a href="http://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu">IDEAL</a>) at <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>. I am very fortunate to be able to learn from and interact with Professors <a href="http://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu/ghosh">Joydeep Ghosh</a>, <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/"> Alex Dimakis</a> and <a href="http://sanmi.cs.illinois.edu">Oluwasanmi Koyejo</a>. My research is on recovering parsimonious structure in the data, specifically sparsity, and exploiting it for prediction. I am also interested in combinatorial aspects of parsimonious structures, their respective connections to convex optimization, and efficient algorithmic development for inference.
	In the past I have worked on problems involving predicting buying propensity based on marketing touches, large scale recommendation systems, Ad Click prediction, and ranking.
