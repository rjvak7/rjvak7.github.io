	I'm a 5th year PhD student in <a href="http://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu/ghosh">Prof Joydeep Ghosh's</a> Intelligent Data Exploration and Analysis Laboratory (<a href="http://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu">IDEAL</a>) at <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>. My research is on recovering parsimonious structure in the data, specifically sparsity, and exploiting it for prediction. 
	In the past I have worked on problems involving predicting buying propensity based on marketing touches, large scale recommendation systems, Ad Click prediction, and ranking.
