	I'm a 4th year PhD student in <a href="http://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu/ghosh">Prof Joydeep Ghosh's</a> Intelligent Data Exploration and Analysis Laboratory (<a href="http://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu">IDEAL</a>) at <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>. My research is on recovering parsimonious structure in the data, specifically sparsity, and exploiting it for prediction. 
	In the past I have worked on problems involving predicting buying propensity based on marketing touches, large scale recommendation systems, Ad Click prediction, and ranking.

<ul>
<li> <b> ETH Zurich:</b> I spent the summer at <a href="http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch"> Data Analytics Lab</a> under Martin Jaggi, and worked on generalized pursuit algorithms.</li>
<li> <b>Microsoft Research (summer intern 2014):</b> I spent the summer at MSR Silicon Valley working on word embeddings.
<li>  <b> LinkedIn (summer intern 2013): </b> I worked on shortening the feedback loop in the Ad serving platform. The project involved working on large scale implementation of Online Logistic Regression on hadoop.
<li> <b> Yahoo! Labs (Full time 2008-2012): </b> I was a Research Engineer in Yahoo! Labs (Bangalore) and worked on various projects including large scale recommendation systems, click through rates, and information corroboration.
